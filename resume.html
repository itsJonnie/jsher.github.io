                  <p>A movie recommendation system built with Python that leverages collaborative filtering techniques. This project uses the MovieLens 100k dataset to suggest movies to users based on their historical ratings. The system implements multiple recommendation models including a simple k‑Nearest Neighbors (k‑NN) model, an SVD-based model, and a hybrid approach. The application is deployed as a Streamlit web app via GitHub and Streamlit Community Cloud.</p>
